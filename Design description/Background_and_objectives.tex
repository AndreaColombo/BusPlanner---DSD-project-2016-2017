\subsection{High level description of the functionalities}
The BusPlanner project is based on an algorithm that aims to reduce the number of buses per route and the time needed to do a scheduling. The users' waiting time will thus be dropped from hours to minutes. 

Users will interact with the system sending requests for a bus, related to a specific position. They will also be able to view the buses' location in the city, thanks to the mapping service the system will make use of. 

On the other hand, bus drivers will receive a notification for each user request, along with all the related information. 

Fleet managers' duty will be to assign each bus to a specific route, in order to satisfy the maximum number of requests in a minimum period of time.
