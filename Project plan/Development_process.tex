\section{DEVELOPMENT PROCESS}
For this project we were suggested to use SCRUM methodology. It is a framework which has customer and communication as its foundation roots. The development process is done in iterations known as Sprints every 2 weeks.
\subsection{Sprint Planning}
We, as a team, decided that sprints will be done in a basis of 2 weeks. During these Sprints, the activities for the coming days will be discussed and there will be an estimation of the tasks, along with several meetings with all the team and scrum coaches.  
\subsection{Sprint Review}
Reviewing the work done so far which will help the team for doing a retrospective. All the non finished work and the high priority works will be scheduled for the next Sprint.
\subsection{Sprint Retrospective}
A retrospective helps in the development process and it is done after the Sprint Review.
This retrospective is needed as it helps in further improvements for the next Sprint. 
\subsection{Daily Scrum meeting}
Basically it is a short meeting where each team member needs to update his/her status on the project. What has been done and what is going to be done. Also, to be pointed the role of the Scrum Master in this meeting as it is his/her job to help the team progress in the process.
