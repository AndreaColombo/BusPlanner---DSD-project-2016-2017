\section{DEVELOPMENT PROCESS}
\subsection{SCRUM Overview}
The team has adopted the SCRUM software development methodology for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It organizes the development process in a way that the problem of requirements volatility and unpredicted changes to the software project is addressed in a robust and relatively simple manner.
	\item It promotes team working and communication.
	\item It imposes a systematic-way-based approach through sprints, meetings and sprint backlogs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprints}
\subsubsection{Sprint 1: 14/11 $\Rightarrow$ 28/11}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fleet Manager can log into the system. 
	\item Fleet Manager is able to manage buses.
	\item Bus Driver can log into the system.	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sprint 2: 28/11 $\Rightarrow$ 12/12}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fleet Manager can manage drivers.
	\item Fleet Manager can get the buses position.
	\item Fleet Manager can manage routes.
	\item Bus Driver can view his personal schedule.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sprint 3: 12/12 $\Rightarrow$ 10/01}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fleet Manager can view all the pendant user requests on the map.
	\item Fleet Manager can view all the previous user requests.
	\item Fleet Manager can get the utilization of each route.
	\item The algorithm assigns buses to routes based on the requests.	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Meetings}
We did:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Daily scrum meetings to assign tasks for the following days. 
	\item Weekly meetings with supervisors (every Friday at 13:30).
	\item Weekly internal meetings right after the meetings with supervisors.
\end{itemize} 
During the meetings we experienced a varying number of participants. 

\subsection{Issues with distributed development}
The greatest challenge has been to coordinate people from different places. This because we experienced some lack of communication from some team members and, also, not all team members participated to the meetings.

During the meetings it was sometimes hard to understand each other because of the language. 

Finally we had some difficulties in dividing the work for the algorithm and testing part. As s consequence, to complete in time the fixed requirements some members had to take care of activities delegated to other members.

\subsection{Things we would change}
In order to avoid the issues that we encountered during the development of this project, we should have attended all the meetings, increased our communication and shared our work more frequently with the other group members.

Regarding the organization part, we should have worked more on the testing part, dedicated more time to the implementation and development part, rather than the documentation part and interacted more with the customer since the beginning.
